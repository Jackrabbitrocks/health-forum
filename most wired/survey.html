				<h2>Most Wired Award</h2>
				<p>A new analytic structure is being used to stratify hospitals based on progress in adoption, implementation and use of information technology in four areas. This structure will produce more meaningful benchmarks. Participating organizations will be identified as <em>Foundational</em>, <em>Core</em>, <em>Advanced</em>, <em>Expert</em> or <em>Leader</em> in each of four focus areas for use of IT:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Infrastructure</li>
					<li>Business and Administrative Management</li>
					<li>Clinical Quality and Safety (Hospital Inpatient/Outpatient)</li>
					<li>Clinical Integration (Ambulatory/Physician/Community)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The survey will continue to recognize hospitals and health systems for excellence in IT, but recognition will be based on the organization's achievements within the analytic structure. The number of organizations recognized (<em>H&amp;HN's</em> Most Wired) will neither be pegged at nor limited to "100 Most Wired" per year. Organizations whose responses reflect "Core" development across all four focus areas are <em>Most Wired</em>.­</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Small and Rural</h2>
				<p>A hospital is considered small and rural based on bed-size (100 beds or less) or location outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as designated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Organizations whose responses reflect development in the four survey focus areas not already recognized on the primary Most Wired list are Most Wired—Small and Rural.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Most Improved</h2>
				<p>Organizations whose responses reflect the most improvement from the last to current survey period not already recognized on the primary Most Wired list are <strong>Most Improved</strong>.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>2016 Innovator Award</h2>
				<p>Up to three winners and three finalists will be selected for the 2016 Most Wired Innovator Award. Organizations may complete a separate application detailing innovative IT solution(s) already implemented at their hospital or system. A panel of hospital and information technology leaders will evaluate IT projects based upon achievement of business objective, creativity and uniqueness of concept, scope of solution and impact on the organization. These organizations may or may not be included in any of the other award types. <a href="http://www.hhnmag.com/mostwired/innovator">Learn More about the Innovator Award</a></p>

					Survey Follow-up and Verification</h2>
					<p>
						Based upon your organization&#39;s answers to survey questions, we may need to follow up to verify your answers or to gather additional information. Each year, approximately 10 percent of participants are verified.</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, you may be contacted to be interviewed for an upcoming article in <a href="http://www.hhnmag.com"><em>H&amp;HN</em> magazine</a>.</p>
