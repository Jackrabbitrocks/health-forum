        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Can my organization be named in more than one category?</strong></a>
            <p>No, organizations receiving the Most Wired designation will not also be named Most Improved or Most Wired Small and Rural. However, your organization also could receive a Most Wired Innovator Award, which has a separate application.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Where is the survey for Most Wireless?</strong></a>
            <p>The Most Wireless Award has been discontinued.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Why can&#39;t I find the application for the Innovator or Supply Chain Innovator awards?</strong></a>
            <p>The Innovator Award was reintroduced in 2011; the application is here. The Supply Chain Innovator award has been changed to The Award for Healthcare Supply Chain Innovation, which is administered by AHRMM for additional information go to <a href="http://www.ahrmm.org/">www.ahrmm.org</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Is there a way to get a copy of the full survey so I can determine if we want to participate or to research the questions before inputting the answers online?</strong></a>
            <p>A PDF of the complete survey is available on the survey site.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Some questions require a screenshot. Where should I send the screenshot?</strong></a>
            <p>Screenshots should be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:mailto:mostwired@healthforum.com">mostwired@healthforum.com</a>. If you are having difficulty sending a screenshot, please contact us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>I am filling out the survey for more than one hospital. How do I answer?</strong></a>
            <p>If you are filling out the survey for more than one hospital, your answers must reflect the <strong>AVERAGE OF ALL HOSPITALS</strong> represented.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Question 14. For what percentage of pharmaceutical supplies is an electronic order generated when they reach a predetermined par level?
            <br>None
            <br>1-20%
            <br>21-40%
            <br>41-60%
            <br>61-80%
            <br>81-100%
            <br>If you are answering the survey for 10 hospitals and <strong>3 of the 10</strong> hospitals order 100% of supplies electronically and the other seven order 0% electronically, you should check the <strong>21-40%</strong> box since 30% is the weighted average across the entire system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Can we put the entire hospital campus (3 hospitals) on one survey? Or would you prefer if we filled out a survey for each hospital?</strong></a>
            <p>You may put the entire campus on one survey.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Are all questions scored?</strong></a>
            <p>No. Questions under the categories of &quot;Organizational Information&quot; and &quot;General Information&quot; are used for identification and benchmarking purposes only; questions labeled &ldquo;Research&rdquo; will be used to understand trends and may have an assigned level which will not affect Most Wired status.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Should outsourcing or application service provider models be included?</strong></a>
            <p>Yes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>On Question 11, &quot;Which of the following wireless applications does your organization support? &quot; you mention &quot;support.&quot; Will &quot;have&quot; suffice?</strong></a>
            <p>The wireless application needs to be actively used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>The survey language in Question 16 says the &quot;payer&#39;s Web site.&quot; We verify almost all of our cases electronically, but it may be through a &quot;clearinghouse&quot; and not the actual payer&#39;s website. Will the clearinghouse also serve as the payer&#39;s website?</strong></a>
            <p>A clearinghouse also serves as the payer&#39;s website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Question 32 asks about educational resources provided to clinicians. Can this include physicians who are not employees?</strong></a>

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Question 40 asks to estimate the percentage of medications matched to the patient by category. Are you looking for medications dispensed or administered?</strong></a>

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Question 84 asks about electronic exchanges of data. Does a fax also qualify as an electronic exchange?</strong></a>
            <p>No, unless data could be extracted from the transaction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Should depreciation and IT expenses in other departments be included in IT operating expense?</strong></a>
            <p>Yes, these expenses are important to include for total operating costs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>What should be included in IT capital?</strong></a>
            <p>We usually include the costs for acquisition, licensing and implementation for infrastructure (hardware, storage, network, data center) and software, as allowed by what can be capitalized per GAAP. As an example, we would include the cost of the PACS application, hardware, etc. But we would not include the digital acquisition devices that we added or swapped out over time. IT capital expense includes IT related capital included in the budget of other departments (e.g., lab, radiology, etc.), if known or can be reasonably estimated. Include the total value of capital leases to be signed in the current year.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>My organization was recognized. What happens next?</strong></a>
            <p>The notification e-mail will include questions for the <em>H&amp;HN</em> July cover story and information on the Leadership Summit and the Most Wired Community website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>When is the embargo date?</strong></a>
            <p>Mid-July is the embargo date. We ask that Most Wired winners do not publicize their awards until after this date. We will send out a press release in mid-July announcing the awards. In addition, the July cover story of <em>H&amp;HN</em> will feature the results along with a list of all winners.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#"><strong>Where can I find logos and press releases to market my Most Wired award?</strong></a>
