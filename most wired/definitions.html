<p>
	<strong>Radio-frequency identification (RFID):</strong> A data collection technology that uses electronic tags for storing data. An RFID tag is an object that can be attached to or incorporated into a product, animal or person for the purpose of identification using radio waves. Passive tags require no internal power source, whereas active tags require a power source. Like bar codes, RFID tags identify items. However, unlike bar codes, which must be in close proximity and in line of sight to the scanner for reading, RFID tags do not require line of sight and can be embedded within packages. Depending on the type of tag and application, they can be read at a varying range of distances.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Radio-frequency location system (RFLS):</strong> RFLS operates on the same principles as RFID, but it takes the technology one step further to provide hospitals with a more comprehensive, real-time solution for tracking and locating assets.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Roaming sessions:</strong> A clinician is allowed to access patient information in an uninterrupted manner from any workstation. Clinicians can begin accessing their patient records on a workstation, and when their clinical workflow requires them to leave, those same patient records are immediately available when logged onto any other workstation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Server virtualization:</strong> (1) Running multiple different operating systems or multiple instances of the same operating system in one server. (2) Treating all servers in a network or server farm as a single resource.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Single sign-on:</strong> A user authentication process that permits a user to enter one name and password in order to access multiple applications. The process authenticates the user for all the applications they have been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when they switch applications during a particular session.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Single sign-off:</strong> Offers a simple one-step logout from all open applications as well as automated timed logout. To adequately secure patient information from unauthorized access, a single sign-on solution must provide single sign-off.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Storage area network (SAN):</strong> A high-speed subnetwork that interconnects different data storage devices with associated data servers for a large network. SANs support disk mirroring, backup and restore, archival and retrieval of archived data, data migration from one storage device to another and the sharing of data among different servers in a network.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Storage virtualization:</strong> The pooling of physical storage from multiple network storage devices into what appears to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console. Storage virtualization is often used in SAN (storage area network), a high-speed subnetwork of shared storage devices, and makes tasks such as archiving, backup and recovery easier and faster. Storage virtualization is usually implemented with software applications or by using hardware and software hybrid appliances.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Structured data:</strong> Data that resides in fixed fields within a record or file. Relational databases and spreadsheets are examples of structured data.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Syndromic surveillance or clinical surveillance system:</strong> In response to the threat of biologic terrorism and the resurgence of virulent forms of infectious diseases, technologic advances are being applied to disease surveillance. Syndromic surveillance systems have emerged to capture and analyze health-indicator data to identify abnormal health conditions and enable early detection of outbreaks. Given the limited public health experience with biologic terrorism and the variety of possible terrorism scenarios, the research community is exploring the application of advanced detection technology to prediagnostic syndromic data.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Traveling profiles:</strong> Also known as roaming profiles are user profiles that are stored in the server. Each time the user logs on; their profile is requested and sent to whatever machine makes the request. This allows the user to move from machine to machine and still maintain a consistent personal working environment. Network administrators find roaming profiles to be especially beneficial in a work or learning environment when more than one user shares the same computer, or when a user moves from place-to-place during the course of a workday.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP):</strong> A category of hardware and software that enables people to use the Internet as the transmission medium for telephone calls by sending voice data in packets using Internet protocol rather than by traditional circuit transmissions of the public switched telephone network. One advantage of VoIP is that the telephone calls over the Internet do not incur a surcharge beyond what the user is paying for Internet access, much in the same way that the user doesn&rsquo;t pay for sending individual e-mails over the Internet.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Wireless security assessment:</strong> Identify and inventory all wireless network access points, identify and exploit weaknesses in the wireless network, and assess the overall exposure of the organization to wireless network attacks.</p>
