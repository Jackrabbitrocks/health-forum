<p>
	Each year, the healthcare supply chain wastes $5 billion, and the number keeps going in one direction &ndash; up.* With declining reimbursement, an aging population and shift to value-based payment models intensifying cost pressures, traditional approaches to supply chain management are no longer working.</p>
<p>
	Join us to understand how automation of your supply chain can lead to cost effective ways of managing your inventory and transparency across your supply chain while re-building trust between the supply chain and clinical teams.</p>
<p>
	Learn how our advanced analytics can help control costs, capture charge accurately and support clinical documentation, all while reducing waste and simplifying workflows. The challenge is knowing where to begin, but the result is true visibility and control to easily manage your supplies.</p>
<p>
	Attendees will be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Describe healthcare trends impacting the supply chain</li>
	<li>
		Identify automated inventory management processes that can help to drive more efficiency from a single location to an enterprise level</li>
	<li>
		Articulate the benefits of automated inventory management to gain support and buy-in with key areas of the hospital</li>
	<li>
		Estimate ROI to support an automation investment in your hospital</li>
</ul>
